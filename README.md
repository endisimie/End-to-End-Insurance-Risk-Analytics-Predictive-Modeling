# End-to-End-Insurance-Risk-Analytics-Predictive-Modeling

This project focuses on analyzing an insurance dataset to uncover patterns in risk exposure, profitability, and claim behavior across various customer and vehicle segments. It includes data quality checks, statistical exploration, visual insights, and loss ratio computation.


## 📌 Objectives

- Explore insurance data for statistical trends and financial patterns.
- Calculate and visualize key metrics like **Loss Ratio (TotalClaims / TotalPremium)**.
- Detect outliers and missing data that may affect performance.
- Perform temporal and geographical trend analysis.
- Automate the workflow with **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**.

# Reproducible and Auditable Data Pipeline using DVC

This project demonstrates how to establish a **reproducible and auditable data pipeline** using **Data Version Control (DVC)**—a critical best practice in regulated industries such as **finance** and **insurance**.

DVC ensures data inputs are version-controlled just like code, supporting compliance, auditability, debugging, and reproducibility of all data science workflows.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Ensure all data and models are fully versioned and auditable.
- Enable reproducibility of results for regulators, stakeholders, or debugging purposes.
- Provide a local remote storage setup to simulate data sharing and collaboration.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- Git
- [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/install) (Data Version Control)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install DVC

Install DVC via pip:

```bash
pip install dvc
